# cnv_sims_inference
CNV simulation and inference of mutation rate and fitness effect


To do:
[] Make the simulator its own seperate script with options for output format that will work with any downstream
[] Implement pyABC as ABC method
[] Improve visualization of performance of algorithms
[] Increase complexity of model
