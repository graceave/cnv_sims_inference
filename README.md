# cnv_sims_inference
CNV simulation and inference of mutation rate and fitness effect


To do:  
- [x] Make the simulator its own seperate script with options for output format that will work with any downstream.  
- [x] Implement pyABC as ABC method.  
- [ ] Add a chemostat simulator
- [ ] DIC fixed vs free parameters
- [ ] Improve visualization of performance of algorithms.  
- [ ] Increase complexity of model.
